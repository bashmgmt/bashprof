//! The wire read as flat records.
//!
//! Every BEGIN carries the name its shell gave the call and the name of the
//! call it was made inside of, so the tree is already on the wire. Reading it
//! is one pass over everything the run heard, with a map from name to call —
//! no grouping by shell, no pairing by position, and nothing that depends on
//! the order messages arrived in.
//!
//! What this pass owes the rest of the module is that the names hold up: a
//! name is given once, ended once, and every name a call points at is one
//! that was given. Each is a lookup, and each failure is the instrument's.
