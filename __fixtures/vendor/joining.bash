# The client's side of a session it drives itself. A script sources this and
# starts a server with it; from then on `BC_INSTR` is defined:
#
#     source lib/joining.bash
#     BC_START bashprof serve --at prof.d --into build.times
#
#     BC_INSTR BASHPROF say STEP compile
#     BC_INSTR BASHPROF ask NEXT
#
#     BC_LEAVE
#
# This file is only ever vendored: it runs before there is anything to inject,
# and is what brings the protocol into the shell in the first place. Every
# other way in is under `bashprof --help` and `bashcap --help`.
#
# The convention has a second half in Rust, `Serving::serve_coprocess`: the
# client holds the server's standard input, and the server writes one line on
# its standard output — the address, the file a shell sources to join. The
# workspace is the client's to name (`--at`), so the address is known before
# the server runs; reading the line is what says the session is laid and
# ready.
#
# The session lasts as long as anyone holds that handle. A subshell inherits it
# and keeps the session open for as long as it lives, because it can still
# speak.

# $@ is the server's command line, program included. `coproc` gives the client
# both ends at once: [0] is where the address arrives, [1] is the handle. NAME
# is a literal in `coproc`'s grammar, so there is one server per shell.
#
# The address lands in BC_SESSION, exported, so this shell's children find it
# where a driven run's shells do. 125 is what the protocol's own words return
# when they could not do their job; a server that died before announcing gives
# end of input instead of a line.
BC_START() {
    coproc BC_SERVER { "$@"; }

    IFS= read -r BC_SESSION <&"${BC_SERVER[0]}" || return 125
    export BC_SESSION
    source "$BC_SESSION"
}

# Let go, and wait for what the client started. Whoever initiates cleans up;
# nothing on the Rust side kills anything. When this returns the server has
# seen the session out and written whatever it writes, and its status is this
# word's.
BC_LEAVE() {
    local __bc_handle="${BC_SERVER[1]}"
    exec {__bc_handle}>&-
